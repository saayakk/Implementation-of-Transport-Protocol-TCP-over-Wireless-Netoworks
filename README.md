# Implementation-of-Transport-Protocol-TCP-over-Wireless-Netoworks
Understanding the disadvantages of traditional TCP over Wireless Sensor Networks and suggesting a possible solution to overcome

TCP works well for wired networks but possesses some issues like reduced throughput in wireless networks because it
considers congestion as sole reason for packet loss, whereas in wireless networks, congestion isnâ€™t the only reason for the loss. Hence, the primary goal is to test the performance of a transport layer protocol in wireless sensor network. We observe the performance parameter, 'Throughput' of the protocol in 3 different implementations.
